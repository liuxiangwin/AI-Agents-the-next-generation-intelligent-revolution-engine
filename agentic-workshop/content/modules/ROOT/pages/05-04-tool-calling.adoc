== **Overview**

While routers provide a limited decision-making scope, tool-calling agents expand the capabilities of an LLM by 
allowing it to interact with external systems. This approach empowers agents to dynamically solve problems by 
utilizing tools, accessing memory, and planning multi-step actions.

Tool calling agents enable:  

1. **Multi-Step Decision Making**: The LLM can orchestrate a sequence of decisions to achieve complex objectives.  
2. **Tool Access**: The LLM can select and use various tools as needed to interact with external systems and APIs.  

This architecture allows for more dynamic and flexible behaviors, enabling agents to solve intricate tasks by 
leveraging external resources efficiently.

== **Tool Calling**

Tools are essential for enabling agents to interact with external systems, such as APIs or databases. 
Since external systems often require specific input schemas or payloads, a tool-calling agent bridges 
the gap between natural language inputs and the structured requirements of these systems.

=== How Tool Calling Works:

1. **Tool Awareness**: The agent is given knowledge of the required input schema for each tool (e.g., parameters or payloads).  
2. **Decision Making**: Based on user input, the LLM decides whether to call a tool and selects the appropriate one.  
3. **Execution**: The agent uses the tool to perform a task, ensuring the input and output align with the tool's requirements.  
4. **Result Handling**: The output from the tool is processed and incorporated into the agentâ€™s response or subsequent actions.

== Exercise: Tool Calling and Routing Agents - Practical Example

Let's see the Tool Calling and Routing Agents in Action!

From the `agentic-workshop/lab-materials/04` folder, please open the notebook called `4.1-agent-routing.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

=== Example Use Cases:

- **API Interaction**: The agent queries a weather API using structured inputs to fetch real-time data.  
- **Data Retrieval**: The agent retrieves information from a database using a specific query format.  
- **Calculations**: The agent performs numerical calculations by calling a computation tool.

== **Benefits of Tool Calling**

- **Expanded Functionality**: Allows agents to perform tasks beyond natural language processing by integrating with external systems.  
- **Dynamic Problem-Solving**: Empowers agents to adapt and plan multi-step actions involving tool usage.  
- **Structured Interactions**: Ensures inputs and outputs adhere to predefined schemas, improving reliability and consistency.
