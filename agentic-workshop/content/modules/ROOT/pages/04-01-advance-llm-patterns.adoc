In this section, we explore common patterns in LLM applications that enhance the model's capabilities without relying on agent-based control flows. These non-agentic patterns focus on leveraging the strengths of LLMs in structured and predictable ways.

== 4.1 Chain of Thought
- Fosters logical reasoning by prompting the LLM to break down tasks step-by-step.
- Improves coherence and context retention in multi-step problem-solving scenarios.
- Enhances the model's ability to generate structured, sequential responses.

== 4.2 Tools Usage from LLM Perspective
- Involves the LLM invoking external tools (e.g., APIs, search engines) to gather information.
- Supports tasks requiring real-time data retrieval, complex computations, or system interactions.
- Extends the LLM's functionality beyond its static training data.

== 4.3 ReAct Prompting
- Combines reasoning and action steps, guiding the LLM to think and act iteratively.
- Uses a Thought → Action → Observation loop for dynamic task execution.
- Enhances decision-making by integrating external information into the reasoning process.

== 4.4 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Merges information retrieval with response generation, grounding the LLM’s answers in real-time data.
- Retrieves relevant documents or knowledge snippets to enhance response accuracy.
- Ideal for applications needing up-to-date or domain-specific information, reducing hallucination risks.
