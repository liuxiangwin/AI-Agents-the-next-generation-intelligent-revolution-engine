== Overview

Welcome to this Agentic Workshop powered by Red Hat AI! 

In this workshop, we will explore what Agentic AI is and how it can enhance Generative AI use cases, 
all deployed on top of our Red Hat AI platforms.

The goal of this workshop is to provide an overview of Agentic AI, its architectures, 
and how to build your first agents to address the limitations of LLMs effectively.

Throughout this workshop, you will progress from the basics of Agentic AI to more advanced architectures, 
where agents collaborate, supervise, and reason/act to solve complex situations and tasks.

Are you ready to dive into the world of Agentic AI with us?

Letâ€™s begin this exciting journey!
