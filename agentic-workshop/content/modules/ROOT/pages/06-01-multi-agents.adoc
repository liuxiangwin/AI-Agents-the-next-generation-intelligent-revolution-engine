== Overview

Multi-agent collaboration is a powerful design pattern in Agentic AI that enables multiple agents to work 
together to solve complex tasks. Instead of relying on a single agent to handle all subtasks, this approach 
assigns specific roles to different agents, allowing each to specialize and contribute effectively.

By breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable subtasks and assigning them to agents with specific expertise, 
this pattern leverages the divide-and-conquer approach to tackle complex scenarios more efficiently.

== How Multi-Agent Collaboration Works

1. **Task Decomposition**:  
   A complex problem is divided into smaller subtasks. Each subtask is assigned to an agent specializing in that domain or task.

2. **Role Assignment**:  
   Agents are designed or prompted for specific roles, such as "researcher" and "chart generator," each with a clear objective and behavior.

3. **Interaction and Communication**:  
   Agents collaborate by passing messages, sharing data, or requesting assistance from other agents to ensure task completion.

4. **Execution and Coordination**:  
   The agents execute their assigned subtasks and combine their results to produce the final outcome.

== Benefits of Multi-Agent Collaboration

- **Scalability**: Allows large, complex tasks to be distributed among multiple agents for faster execution.
- **Specialization**: Enables agents to focus on specific subtasks, optimizing their effectiveness.
- **Robustness**: Reduces the likelihood of errors by isolating subtasks and handling them individually.

== Example Use Case

For a task like generating insights, multi-agent collaboration might involve:

- A **Researcher Agent** to gather relevant data or information through APIs or databases.  
- A **Chart Generator Agent** to process the retrieved data and create visual representations like charts or graphs.  
- A **Router Agent** to manage task flow and coordinate between the Researcher and Chart Generator agents.

This modular approach ensures a streamlined workflow where each agentâ€™s expertise contributes to solving the overall problem.
